# Yelp Demo

This is an Yelp-search iOS application for displaying the search results of a business.

Time spent: 32 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Search results page
 * [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
 * [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
 * [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
 * [x] The filters are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
 * [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
 * [x] Radius filter expands as in the real Yelp app
 * [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list 
 * [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
